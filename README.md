# azure-platform-terraform

The intent of this repo is to build foundational Azure Landing Zone components using the [Azure/caf-enterprise-scale](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/caf-enterprise-scale/azurerm/latest) module.

There are some customizations in terms of Management Group naming and policy assignments so be sure to inspect some of the locals.\*.tf, variables.tf, and \*.json files in the /lib directory.
